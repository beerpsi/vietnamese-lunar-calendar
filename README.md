# vietnamese-lunar-calendar
A program to convert the current solar date into Vietnamese lunar date (TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM CHINESE LUNAR DATE)

This project is based off [Ho Ngoc Duc](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/)'s Java version, written in C to ensure the best performance

# TODO
- [ ] Add the ability to format the output string, like `date`

- [ ] Add the ability to convert any day, not just today
